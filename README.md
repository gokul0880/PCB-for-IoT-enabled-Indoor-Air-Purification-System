# PCB for IoT-enabled Indoor Air Purification System

This repository contains the PCB design files for an IoT-enabled Indoor Air Purification System. The system is designed to monitor and improve indoor air quality by integrating various sensors and actuators. The PCB facilitates the seamless connection of components such as air quality sensors, microcontrollers, and purification units.

## Features

- **Air Quality Monitoring**: Integrates sensors to detect pollutants like PM2.5, CO₂, and VOCs.
- **IoT Connectivity**: Supports Wi-Fi/Bluetooth modules for real-time data transmission.
- **Automated Control**: Enables automatic activation of purification mechanisms based on sensor readings.
- **Compact Design**: Optimized PCB layout for space-efficient deployment.

## Repository Contents

- `schematics/` – Circuit diagrams in PDF and source formats.
- `pcb_layout/` – PCB design files compatible with [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) or [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview).
- `bom/` – Bill of Materials listing all components with specifications.
- `firmware/` – Sample code for microcontroller integration (if applicable).
- `docs/` – Additional documentation, including setup guides and user manuals.
